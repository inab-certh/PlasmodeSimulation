Description: PlasmodeSimulation is an R-package for creating simulated versions
  of healthcare databases—mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model—based on predefined
  cohorts. Unlike conventional approaches that fully generate synthetic
  patient-level data (demographics, diagnoses, medications, etc.), plasmode
  simulations reuse real patient records and focus on simulating only the
  outcomes. Specifically, after fitting outcome models to the observed data, the
  package generates new outcomes for every patient. Although still in early
  development, PlasmodeSimulation can already produce benchmark datasets with
  known positive and negative controls (i.e., treatment–outcome pairs with
  established effect sizes) to rigorously evaluate pharmacovigilance methods.
